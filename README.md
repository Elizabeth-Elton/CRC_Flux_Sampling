# CRC_Flux_Sampling
Scripts to generate results and figures for flux sampling manuscript

Flux Sampling:
Contains files used to build the base model(s) (adapted from Wang et al 2022), perfom enzyme knockdowns (adapted from Tavakoli et al 2025), and perform flux sampling. 
Flux sampling results for the knockdown models can be found in .mat form in 'sampling_results.zip' and 'sampling_results_crc.zip'. Results for the base models can be found in '_1.mat' and 'base_crc_model_samples.mat'.

Representation learning:
Contains files used to generate NN and perform representatinon learning on sampling data. RL projection results are stored in 'projection_data_12.csv'.

Data analysis:
Contains files used for the processing of representation learning and sampling results, as well as generating the original list of knockdown models of interest.
